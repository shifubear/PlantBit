# PlantBit
The FitBit for Plants

PlantBit is a 24 hour hackathon project that simulates how plant grow light photoperiods can be regulated through a Google Mini or remotely through an iPhone app. 
Firebase database was used to collect information about photoperiod and soil moisture (recorded as a subcomponent of "plant health").
IPhone and Google Mini were connected to an Arduino Uno which controlled LED lights as a model of a more extensive controlled environments system.
